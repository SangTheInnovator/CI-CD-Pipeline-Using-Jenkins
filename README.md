## Introduction
In this project, we will use different tools such as Jenkins, SonaQube, Docker, and AWS EC2 to build an automated CI/CD pipeline for a web application. This pipeline includes build, testing, and deploying the web application on AWS EC2 instances.

## Build and setup
1. Create EC2 Instances
2. Setting up Instances
3. Integrating SonarQube for Jenkins
4. Create a Jenkins for Deploying Web Application
   - Configuring Pipeline for SonarQube
   - Configuring Pipeline for Docker

  ### Create EC2 Instances
  - Create key pair
    
  - Create Security Group
    
  - Create two EC2 instances
  ### Setting up Instances
  
  ### Integrating SonarQube for Jenkins
  
  ### Create Jenkins for Deploying Web Application
